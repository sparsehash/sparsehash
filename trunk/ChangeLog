	* sparsehash: initial release:
	  The sparsehash package contains several hash-map implementations,
	  similar in API to SGI's hash_map class, but with different
	  performance characteristics.  sparse_hash_map uses very little
	  space overhead: 1-2 bits per entry.  dense_hash_map is typically
	  faster than the default SGI STL implementation.  This package
	  also includes hash-set analogues of these classes.

	* sparsehash: version 0.2 release
	* Preliminary support for msvc++ compilation. (csilvers)
	* Documentation fixes -- some example code was incomplete! (csilvers)
	* Minimize size of config.h to avoid other-package conflicts (csilvers)
	* Contribute a C-based version of sparsehash that served as the
	  inspiration for this code.  One day, I hope to clean it up and
	  support it, but for now it's just in experimental/, for playing
	  around with. (csilvers)
	* Change default namespace from std to google. (csilvers)

	* sparsehash: version 0.3 release
	* Quiet compiler warnings on some compilers. (csilvers)
	* Some documentation fixes: example code for dense_hash_map. (csilvers)
	* Fix a bug where swap() wasn't swapping delete_key(). (csilvers)
	* set_deleted_key() and set_empty_key() now take a key only,
	  allowing hash-map values to be forward-declared. (csilvers)
	* support for std::insert_iterator (and std::inserter). (csilvers)
